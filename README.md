# DLx Data Explorer

The DLx portal for viewing, searching, and aggregating data. This site is aimed and searching data across projects and doculects. For viewing data on individual projects and doculects, use the [Lotus app][Lotus].

This project will be a Node.js-based server with (mostly) static pages (otherwise data for ALL languages would have to be stored locally), using Handlebars templating.
