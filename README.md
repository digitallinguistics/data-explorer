# DLx Data Explorer

The DLx portal for viewing, searching, and aggregating data

Alternate domains:
* `data.digitallinguistics.io`
* `explorer.digitallinguistics.io`

This project will be a Node.js-based server with (mostly) static pages (otherwise data for ALL languages would have to be stored locally), using Handlebars templating.

The user should be able to browse data by Project or Language (and maybe later, Language Family).

Each Project/Language should then list the available texts, lexicons, and comparative lexicons (diachronic or synchronic).

Each Project, Lexicon, and Dictionary will have a project description that the user can enter (in the app), and this will be displayed as a readme of sorts for the project.

**Dictionary views**
- traditional vs. relaxed views of entries
- show/hide fields
