# DLx Data Explorer

The DLx portal for viewing, searching, and aggregating data

Alternate domains:
* `data.digitallinguistics.io`
* `explorer.digitallinguistics.io`

This project will be a Node.js-based server with (mostly) static pages (otherwise data for ALL languages would have to be stored locally), using Handlebars templating.
